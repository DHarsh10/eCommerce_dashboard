Used create-react-app to set up the React application.
Imported fonts from Google Fonts.
Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling the components.
Configured tailwind.config.js to enable toggling between dark and light modes.
Created a themeContext using the Context API to store the theme mode and make it available throughout the application.
Set up routing using the React Router library.
Used Material-UI components to create dropdowns, tables, and other elements.
Utilized Material-UI charts to add graphs and charts to the application.
Styled components using Tailwind CSS along with custom CSS.


Challenges faced while building the dashboard:
1. Unclear Functional Requirements: Without fully understanding the functionality, it was challenging to design the components effectively. Developing UI components without knowing the complete flow or interactivity.

2. Time Constraints and Code Cleanliness: Due to time constraint, maintaining clean code, especially in terms of styling, was difficult. 

3. Styling Consistency: Ensuring that the styling across components remained consistent was challenging, particularly under time pressure. 

4. Component Readability: With many components in the project, making sure each one was easy to read and understand was important. It was challenging to find the right balance between making the components functional and keeping the code clean and easy to maintain.

5. Component Size Limitation: Itâ€™s best to keep components under 100 lines of code. It was challenging to manage the functionality and logic within this limit while making sure each component stayed modular, reusable, and self-contained.

Note: Due to time constraints, some design elements were left unfinished, and I couldn't fully focus on implementing the dark mode interactivity or ensuring the dashboard's responsiveness according to best practices. As a result, there might be a few bugs in the functionality as well.
